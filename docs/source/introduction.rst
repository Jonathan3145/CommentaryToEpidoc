A Python module called CommentaryToEpidoc has been written by Jonathan
Boyle (University of Manchester) to convert transcribed commentaries
to EpiDoc compatible XML.

The version of Python is Python 3.5.1 (using Anaconda Python
2.4.1). For more information on EpiDoc see the official website
`EpiDoc <http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/>`_ and the associated
`wiki <http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/>`_.

The commentaries were transcribed by `Kamran Karimullah
<mailto:karimullah.kamran@manchester.ac.uk>`_ and colleagues at the
University of Manchester.

Kamran also specified the requirements for the module.

The commentaries are Arabic, however the module can process text in
any language.

The work was funded from an ERC funded project studying Arabic
commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms, the Principal Investigator
was Peter E. Pormann (The University of Manchester).
